      About AIMe
    </h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        New promising AI technologies for biomedical applications are suggested almost every day.
        However, a major hurdle for their application in clinical practice is that practitioners generally do not yet
        trust these technologies.
        One reason for this is that AI decisions are often opaque and difficult to explain.
        The AIMe registry is designed to address this problem by providing authors of new AIs with a means to report
        their AI models in an explicit and transparent fashion.

        AIMe has been developed and is being maintained by the
        <a href="https://baumbachlab.net">Chair of Experimental Bioinformatics</a> at the
        <a href="https://www.tum.de/en/">Technical University of Munich</a>.
