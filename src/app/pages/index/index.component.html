    <div class="content vision">
      In the past years, AI led to tremendous advances in the field of biomedical research and new approaches are
      suggested almost every day. However, varying evaluation schemes are employed and usually only selected aspects
      of the data analysis results are reported. This is detrimental for comparability and reproducibility of different
      AI models as well as for the development of novel, better AI methods. Hence, we have decided to develop the AIMe
      standard, which aims at becoming a standardized reporting standard for AI in biomedicine.

        AIMe aims to be a standard for the AI community in biomedicine.
        Therefore, we believe that it should also be shaped by the community.
